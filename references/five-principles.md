# Five Principles of Readability

## 1. Space

Increasing the amount of space makes it **easier to process**. The more space around text, the **more attention** is available for content.

**Easiest ways** of increasing space:
- Larger font
- Increased line spacing (ideal: 1.2-1.5)
- Shorter lines (50-70 characters)

**Avoid** formatting that distorts or crowds text:
- Underlining
- ALL CAPS
- Italics for whole paragraphs
- Centred paragraphs
- Justified blocks without hyphenation
- Table borders too close to text

## 2. Chunks

Splitting text into smaller **chunks makes it easier to process**. Readers can **skim and scan more quickly**. Readers under stress find chunked text **more approachable**.

**Break**:
1. Text into **sections and subsections** marked with headings
2. Lists into **bullet points** or **numbered lists**
3. Blocks of text into **shorter paragraphs**

Do this even for **one-page documents**.

## 3. Guides

Adding guides to text **helps processing**. Readers spend less time decoding and can **focus on your message**.

Types of guides:
1. **Bold key phrases** in long paragraphs
2. Provide an **outline summary**
3. Add **icons** to help recall
4. Summarise instructions with **flowcharts** and mind maps
5. Use **images** to illustrate

## 4. Information Structure

Give the **important information first**. We often start with background that readers skip. Put **background second or last**.

Types of information that can come later:
1. Welcomes and thanks (readers don't notice when missing)
2. Historical or institutional background
3. Information obvious from title or layout (can often be omitted)

**Take cues from journalism** - start with new information.

**Important!** This does NOT mean omit important information. Put useful background at the end or in a linked document.

Three tips for **better information structure**:
1. Move **background last**
2. Organise into **smaller chunks**
3. **Show the outline** of the text

## 5. Simple Language

Three simple-to-follow rules:

1. **Use shorter sentences** (average 15-20 words)
2. **Address the reader** when appropriate (use "you" or commands)
3. **Use verbs** instead of nouns when possible ("when you arrive" vs "upon arrival")
