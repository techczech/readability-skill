# Jargon and Acronyms

Avoiding jargon and acronyms is common advice for simple readable language. Unfortunately, this is **not easy advice to put into action**. Whether acronyms or jargon are appropriate depends on the subject and audience.

## Jargon and Difficult Words

What is a difficult word or jargon **varies by the knowledge and experience of the reader**.

**Key insight:** The problem with using jargon in public communication is not that the reader does not know it but that it is **used unthinkingly**. It is possible to use jargon in such a way that the reader's knowledge is built up as they read.

### Types of Audiences and Their Needs

| Audience Type | Needs | Strategies |
|---------------|-------|------------|
| **Professional in-group** | Jargon is part of expected vocabulary | Use jargon freely |
| **Professional out-group** (related profession) | May be unfamiliar with specialist terms | Use jargon but define specialist terms; consider if same jargon has different meanings in subdisciplines |
| **Prospective members** (students, trainees) | Unfamiliar but expected to learn | Build readers' knowledge gradually; provide frequent definitions and glossaries; consider stage of learning |
| **General public** | Unfamiliar; won't engage long enough to learn | Avoid jargon if possible; repeat terms rather than using pronouns; check understanding with outside reader |

### Important Note

Avoiding jargon is a balancing act with **no perfect solution**. Even with care, many professional writers may not realise that terms they use daily in informal conversations are actually jargon.

Also, **jargon is usually not the biggest problem** the reader will face. Often, dense paragraphs with long complex sentences will be more of a problem.

## Acronyms

Acronyms are a **type of jargon**. All the tips about jargon apply.

### Pros of Acronyms
- Reduce amount of repetitive text
- Make sentences with complex structures easier to process
- Use more familiar form of a name to a group

### Cons of Acronyms
- Readers with **dyslexia struggle** with processing unfamiliar words
- **Screen readers** pronounce acronyms unpredictably
- People outside your group have to learn them as jargon

Many acronyms just become words for groups who use them often. They become part of expected vocabulary. It would be doing readers a disservice not to use the acronym even if the reader is new to the group.

### How to Use Acronyms by Audience

| Audience | Document Types | Strategies |
|----------|----------------|------------|
| **Internal group** | Emails, memos, guides, policy docs | Use common acronyms freely without providing full text; ensure new members can access acronyms |
| **Professional with external members** | Academic publications, reports for professional bodies | Explain all acronyms at least once; provide glossary if many new acronyms; exceptions for well-known acronyms (DfE, DoJ, EU) |
| **Public communication** | Websites, PR documents, public guidance | Avoid acronyms altogether; when necessary for readability, provide explanation; spell out again after a few paragraphs |

### Ad-hoc Acronyms

Writers in academic settings often make up acronyms for repetitive terms. Often for two contrasting terms.

**This is almost never worth it.**

Remember: A paragraph that may take you 15-30 minutes to write will take your reader about 1 minute to read. The reader has much less time to become familiar with it. Readers are **more likely to confuse the terms** and misunderstand the text.
