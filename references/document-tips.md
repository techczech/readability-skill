# 10 Simple Things for More Readable Documents

## 1. Headings

Break documents into sections using headings and subheadings.

**Critical:** Mark headings with styles (Heading 1, Heading 2, etc.) - not just bold text. This is essential for accessibility.

## 2. Bullet Points

- Break lists into bullet points
- Number the list if you often refer to individual points

## 3. Shorter Paragraphs

Break text into shorter paragraphs. This:
- Greatly increases ease of scanning
- Prevents readers being put off by large text blocks

## 4. Bold Key Phrases

**Bold key phrases** in longer paragraphs. This has been shown to **increase comprehension**.

**Do not bold:**
- Entire sentences
- Whole paragraphs
- Blocks of bold text are more difficult to process visually

## 5. Background Last

Start with the key new information. Do not leave out important background but **put it last**.

Often you just need to take the first paragraph and move it to second or end.

**Skip decorative text:**
- Welcomes and introductions are often decorative
- They get in the way of actual content

## 6. Show Outline

Show the outline of text using:
- A table of contents
- A list of bullets with key points
- Icons with key words

## 7. Shorter Sentences

Shortening sentences improves readability more than any other language advice.

**Target:** Average between **15-20 words per sentence**

Other language tips:
- Address the reader rather than talk about them
- Use verbs rather than nouns when possible
- Avoid repeating the same word in lists

## 8. Line Length Under 70 Characters

Shorter lines are easier to scan. Keep lines between **50-70 characters**.

Benefits:
- People using **magnifiers** find them easier to follow
- **Increasing font size** achieves the same effect

## 9. Font Size and Line Spacing

Increase reading speed by up to 10% by making font bigger and increasing line spacing.

**Ideal line spacing:** 1.2-1.5

**Ideal font sizes** (vary by typeface):
- Handout: Arial 14pt
- Long expository text: Times New Roman 13pt
- PowerPoint slides: Arial 28pt or more
- Email: Calibri 14pt

## 10. Graphics Use

Graphics can:
- Increase comprehension
- Ease navigation
- Make text more approachable

**Good uses:**
- Icons added to lists
- Charts used to summarise
- Images used to illustrate

**Avoid:**
- Superfluous images
- Images not related to text
- Very busy and distracting images or icons
