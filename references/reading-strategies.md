# How People Read: Strategies and Cognitive Load

## Most Documents Are Not Stories

We learn reading on stories - read start to finish, remember, move on. But **most documents are not stories** and should not be read that way.

## 5 Assumptions About Readers

When creating documents, assume most readers will:

1. **Not read** from start to finish
2. **Not read** every word
3. **Skim first** to decide whether or how much to read
4. **Return** to find specific information
5. **Read many documents** just before or after

People **read strategically**. Many students struggle because they do NOT read strategically. **Format documents to support strategic reading**.

## 3 Reading Strategies Documents Should Support

The most common strategy: **read it later** (often meaning **never**).

Once readers start, they use one of three modes:

### Comprehensive (Linear)
- Read from start to finish
- Never skip
- Used for stories or magazine articles

**How to support:**
- Start with important information first
- Create logical structure or narrative arc
- Use repetition for cohesive reading experience

### Skimming
- Read for gist and general understanding
- Decide if more reading is necessary
- Jump to the end first
- Read table of contents
- Read only first sentences of paragraphs
- Read only highlighted information
- Randomly jump around for key words

**How to support:**
- Include table of contents
- Label sections with headings
- Provide graphical summaries
- Use lists
- Highlight key words and phrases
- Shorten paragraphs

### Scanning
- Read to find specific information
- Often used on second or third pass
- Often used to get to passages for close reading

**How to support:**
- All skimming strategies help scanning
- Make table of contents clickable
- Mark headings with heading styles
- Bookmark PDFs
- Make all text searchable

## Cognitive Load Theory

**Cognitive load** is the amount of information placed in working memory. Working memory **limits what you can reason about**.

Working memory is **limited to a small number of chunks**. Additional elements reduce what a person can do.

But **individual chunks can be very large** and rich. The richer, the better. Reduce cognitive load by **increasing meaningful chunks**.

### What Increases Cognitive Load
- Hard to read text
- Distractions
- Irrelevant images
- Unasked for movement
- Noise

### What Decreases Cognitive Load
- Shorter chunks
- Meaningful chunks
- Meaningful structure
- Visual guides to structure
- Combined text and audio

### When Cognitive Load Is Stressed

**Situational demands** - processing takes more effort when:
- Tired
- Busy
- In a new environment

**Permanent demands** - conditions placing additional load on working memory:
- Visual impairment
- Dyslexia
- Attention disorders
- Mental illness (stress, anxiety)
- Non-native language
