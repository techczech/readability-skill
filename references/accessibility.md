# Accessibility Considerations

## Who Benefits from Readable Documents

All the readability principles help **everyone**, but especially benefit:

- **Dyslexic readers** - struggle with dense text, benefit from chunking and visual guides
- **Non-native speakers** - simpler language and structure aids comprehension
- **Screen reader users** - properly marked headings are essential
- **Low vision users** - larger fonts, more space, shorter lines
- **Attention disorders** - chunked content and clear structure reduce cognitive load
- **People under stress** - approachable formatting reduces barrier to entry

## Key Accessibility Principles

### Headings Must Be Marked with Styles

**Critical:** Use Heading 1, Heading 2, etc. styles - not just bold text.

Why:
- Screen readers use headings to navigate
- Users can jump between sections
- Creates automatic table of contents
- Bold text alone provides no structure for assistive technology

### Text Alternatives for Images

When documents include images or tables:
- Write **functional descriptions** focusing on the textual alternative
- Describe what the image communicates, not just what it shows
- Tables need headers marked properly

### Colour Cannot Be the Only Indicator

Never use colour as the only way to convey information.

**Bad:** "Items marked in red are compulsory"

**Good alternatives to add:**
- Bolding
- Shapes or outline styles
- Asterisks
- Consistent position
- Different icons

### PDF Accessibility

For accessible PDFs:
1. Start with accessible source document (Word with proper headings)
2. Export/save as PDF with accessibility options enabled
3. Check reading order
4. Ensure all images have alt text
5. Add bookmarks for navigation
6. Test with a screen reader if possible

### Common Issues

**Five most common accessibility issues:**
1. Missing heading structure (just bold instead of heading styles)
2. Images without alt text
3. Links without meaningful text ("click here")
4. Colour-only information
5. Poor reading order in PDFs

## Dyslexia-Specific Considerations

What helps dyslexic readers:
- **Increased line spacing** (1.5 minimum)
- **Shorter lines** (50-60 characters ideal)
- **Sans-serif fonts** (though research is mixed)
- **Larger font sizes** (14pt minimum)
- **Left-aligned text** (not justified)
- **Clear structure** with headings and bullets
- **Bold key phrases** for scanning
- **Avoiding italics** for long passages
- **Cream or light coloured backgrounds** instead of pure white

## Screen Reader Considerations

For screen reader users:
- Proper heading hierarchy (H1, H2, H3 in order)
- Meaningful link text
- Alt text for images
- Table headers marked correctly
- Lists using actual list formatting
- Language specified in document
- Reading order matches visual order
