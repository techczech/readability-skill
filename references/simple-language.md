# 3 Steps to Simpler Language

## 1. Shorten Sentences

Long sentences take more time and effort to process visually and grammatically. Keep your **average length under 20 words**.

**Why long sentences are difficult:**
1. Harder to visually scan to important points
2. Require more complex grammar
3. More to keep in memory
4. Readers skimming may miss important connections

**How to shorten sentences:**
1. Divide at conjunctions like "but" or "and" (starting sentences this way is fine)
2. Instead of "and", start a new sentence
3. Instead of "because", start next sentence with "This is because"
4. Convert long sequences to lists
5. Rephrase with a command (plain verb without "to")

**Signal words** suggesting sentence is too long:
- While
- Whether
- However

**When NOT to shorten:**
1. Expressing complex ideas requiring deep engagement
2. Splitting would create more language to process

## 2. Address the Reader

Addressing readers signals that content applies to them, making them **more likely to pay attention**.

Three ways to address readers:
1. Use **"you"** instead of a noun describing the reader
   - "You must wear a mask" instead of "Attendees must wear a mask"
2. Use **direct commands** rather than "you should" or "can you"
3. Use **"we"** instead of institution name
   - "We will help you" instead of "Our organisation will help you"

## 3. Use Verbs Instead of Nouns

Written English overuses nouns. Official documents often use **nouns to describe actions**, which takes **longer to process** and makes readers **less likely to act**.

Complicated nouns common in academic/bureaucratic English:
- Provision
- Availability
- Attendance
- Failure

**Example transformation:**

| Before (nouns) | After (verbs) |
|----------------|---------------|
| Failure to achieve compliance will result in prosecution. | If you fail to comply, you will be prosecuted. |
| The submission is due on Tuesday. | You must submit the document by Tuesday. |
| Upon arrival, registration is required. | When you arrive, please register. |
| Addition of new tasks without consultation has the potential of goal obfuscation. | If we add new tasks without consulting others, we may lose sight of our goals. |

The benefit of verbs is putting the writer into **more direct speech**, making it easier to make content relevant to readers.

## About Passive Voice

**Important:** Avoiding passives is NOT the most important readability advice. Many guides overemphasise this.

The real issue is usually **indirect sentences** without clear subjects. Focus on:
- Having an **active subject** (you, we, I)
- **Addressing the reader** directly
- Making clear **who does what**

Better advice than "avoid passives":
- "The forms should be submitted" → "You should submit the form"
- "The website should be updated" → "We should update the website"
- "Attendees must arrive early" → "You should arrive early" (if writing for attendees)
