# 10 Simple Things for More Readable PowerPoints

## 1. Text Size

Set text minimum to **28pt for Arial**. Other fonts may need bigger sizes.

- Text can be slightly smaller when presenting online
- If presenting **text under 18pt**, don't expect audience to read it
- Larger text forces you to:
  - Break text over multiple slides
  - Use fewer bullet points
  - Create summary slides

## 2. Short Lines

Do not have lines run across the whole slide. Keep to **under 30 characters** per line.

Get shorter lines by:
1. Increasing font size
2. Using two columns
3. Using SmartArt

## 3. Bolding of Key Phrases

**Bold key phrases** in any block of text such as quotations. Bold key phrases or key words in **longer lists**.

**Avoid:**
- Bolding complete sentences
- Bolding whole paragraphs
- Too much bold is difficult to process visually

## 4. No Text Over Images

Do not place text over an image. Always **add a solid background** to text if the slide has an image background.

- Make text background slightly transparent (no more than 25%)
- Increase transparency of background images to reduce distraction

## 5. Remove Logos from Every Slide

You do not need a logo on every slide. Keep branding to **title and final slide only**.

Logos on every slide introduce potential distraction.

## 6. Convert Bullets to SmartArt

Use SmartArt instead of bullets. Right-click on any list and choose: **Convert to SmartArt**.

**Benefits of SmartArt:**
- Provides visual division
- Makes it easier to indicate relationships
- Makes it easier to combine text and icons

**When using SmartArt avoid:**
- Small text
- Too much text
- Very busy and complicated layouts

**SmartArt tips:**
- Use Design Ideas to convert lists
- Edit text in the SmartArt outline, not graphics
- Convert SmartArt to shapes for further editing

## 7. Add Icons or Colours to Lists

Adding icons or colours makes lists easier to process and remember. Icons also provide visual division.

Benefits:
- Easier to process
- Easier to remember
- Easier visual navigation

**Important!** Never use **colour as the only way** to convey information. Also use:
- Bolding
- Shapes or outline styles
- Asterisks
- Consistent position
- Graphics

## 8. Use Animations to Draw Attention

Animations can be distracting. **Use them minimally.** But they can draw interest to particular elements.

**Helpful animation examples:**
1. **Arrow** Wipe or Fly in to point to image elements
2. **Circle Wipe** to highlight text
3. **Colour change** of a slide element

**Tip:** Add multiple animations to the same element.

Your aim: **Draw viewers' attention** to what you're discussing in a way that supports understanding. Animation can help but can also distract.

## 9. Make Images Full Screen

Stretch images across the whole screen for more impact.

This achieves:
1. Zoom in on what is important
2. Forces you to use less text
3. Makes the slide look more modern

**Cropping and zooming:**
- Don't be afraid to crop - it's essential for amplifying message
- Cropping can leave more room for text
- Professional photographers and artists crop extensively

## 10. Design Ideas

Use PowerPoint's **Design Ideas** feature to:
- Get automatic layout suggestions
- Convert lists to SmartArt
- Add visual interest to plain slides

Click on a slide and look for Design Ideas in the Design tab or right sidebar.
