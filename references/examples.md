# Examples of Simplified Language

Concrete examples showing how to apply readability principles.

## Addressing the Reader

Using principles of simple language, rephrasing text to address the reader changes the focus.

### Example: Leave Policy

**Before (abstract):**
> More leave possible for employees. Employers can choose to offer more leave than the legal minimum. Extra leave does not require same rules as statutory leave.

**After (addressing reader):**
> - Your employer **can choose to offer more leave** than the legal minimum
> - **Extra leave** you receive does **not require same rules** as statutory leave
> - **Example:** Extra leave may only be available to you after you have been employed for some time

## Using Verbs Instead of Nouns

### Example: Assignment Brief

**Before (abstract nouns):**
> The purpose of the assignment is to provide candidates with the opportunity to demonstrate that they have understood the key concepts and frameworks covered in the module and are able to synthesise and analyse this material, including examples, to construct a coherent argument.

**After (addressing reader):**
> This assignment will **give you an opportunity** to demonstrate that **you have understood** the key concepts and frameworks covered in the module and that **you are able** to synthesise and analyse this material, **include examples, and construct** a coherent argument.

## Shortening Sentences

The example above can also be improved by **splitting it into two sentences**:

> This assignment will give you an opportunity to demonstrate that you have understood the key concepts and frameworks covered in the module. You will also show that you can synthesise and analyse this material, include examples, and construct a coherent argument.

The reader of the modified version is more likely to focus on all parts of the assignment.

## Reducing Decorative Text

Decorative text often adds processing burden without adding useful information.

**Key insight:** When redesigning, replacing prominent welcome messages with bullet points outlining key information and quick links often works better.

The amount of text may not change. In fact, **words may be added to section links** to give readers a sense of what they can expect on the page.

## Common Transformations

| Pattern | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Noun to verb** | "Failure to achieve compliance" | "If you fail to comply" |
| **Institution to we** | "Our organisation will help you" | "We will help you" |
| **3rd person to you** | "Attendees must wear a mask" | "You must wear a mask" |
| **Passive to active** | "The form should be submitted" | "Please submit the form" |
| **Noun phrase** | "Upon arrival, registration is required" | "When you arrive, please register" |
| **Long nominalization** | "The submission is due on Tuesday" | "You must submit by Tuesday" |

## Complex Example

**Before:**
> Addition of new tasks without cross-institution stakeholder consultation has the potential of goal obfuscation.

**After:**
> If we add new tasks without consulting people from different institutions we work with, we run the risk that we will lose sight of our goals.
